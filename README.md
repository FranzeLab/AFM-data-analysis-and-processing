# AFM data analysis and processing

Contains all MATLAB and python scripts related to AFM data analysis and processing. 

-Batchforce: script for analysing force-distance curves obtained from AFM measurements (Matlab)

-WriteLabFile: takes force curves and spits out timestamps and x,y coordinates (to make 2D stiffness maps, coordinates required) (Matlab)

-elasticitymapfinal_matlabfigs: plots colour maps of stiffness readout in x- and y- (Matlab)

-ROIsForStiffnessGradient: calculate stiffness in two user specified regions of interest (of the same size) on either side of a used specified feature. (Matlab)
